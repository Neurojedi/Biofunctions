The Proteins.ipynb file contains useful examples that demonstrate the proper usage of functions. If you are looking to understand how to utilize the functions, you can refer to the jupyter notebook. Below, you can also find a brief overview of the outputs generated by functions in the python files.

**Translation:** This file contains `get_translation` function that returns the translation of a Pattern into an amino acid string Peptide.

**Transcribe:** This file contains the `get_reversetranscription` and `get_transcription` functions that can be used to get transcription (RNA string) and reverse transcription (DNA string) of corresponding patterns.

**PeptideEncoding:** This file contains `PeptideEncoding` function that returns all substrings of Text encoding Peptide (if any such substrings exist).

**Cyclospectrum:** This file contains `Cyclospectrum` function that returns Cyclospectrum(Peptide).

**CountingMass:** This file contains `CountingMass` function that returns the number of linear peptides having integer mass m.

**LinearSubPeptideCount:** This file contains `LinearSubpeptideCount` function that returns the number of subpeptides of a linear peptide of length n.

**LinearSpectrum:** This file contains `LinearSpectrum` function that returns the linear spectrum of a peptide.

**CycloPeptideSequencing:** This file contains `CycloPeptideSequencing` function that uses the branch-and-bound algorithm and returns peptides which satisfies the following condition Cyclospectrum(Peptide) = Spectrum(given as input).

**LeaderboardCyclopeptideSequencing :** This file contains `LeaderboardCyclopeptideSequencing ` function that returns the LeaderPeptide after running LeaderboardCyclopeptideSequencing(Spectrum, N).

**SpectrumConvolution:** This file contains `SpectrumConvolution` function that returns the list of elements in the convolution of Spectrum. 

**ConvolutionCyclopeptideSequencing:** This file contains `ConvolutionCyclopeptideSequencing` function that returns a cyclic peptide LeaderPeptide with amino acids taken only from the top M elements (and ties) of the convolution of Spectrum that fall between 57 and 200, and where the size of Leaderboard is restricted to the top N (and ties).
