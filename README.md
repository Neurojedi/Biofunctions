## üó®Ô∏è Biofunctions

This repository includes Python implementations of some of the commonly used bioinformatics algorithms. I implemented these functions on Python for my assignments in the first three courses of [Bioinformatics Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics) on Coursera. Each sub-folder includes one Jupyter Notebook that introduces how to use the functions in the folder.
