**1. MahattanTourist:** The function returns the length of the longest path in the Manhattan Tourist Problem. 

**2. OutputLCS:** Given two strings s and t, the function returns the longest common subsequence of s and t.

**3. Longest Path DAG:** The function returns the desired output for the Longest Path along the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) problem.

**4. GlobalAlignment:** The function returns the maximum alignment score of two strings followed by an alignment achieving this maximum score.

**5. LocalAlignment:** The function returns the maximum score of a local alignment of the strings, followed by a local alignment of these strings achieving the maximum score.

**6. EditDistance:** The function returns the edit distance between two strings.

**7. FittingAlignment:** The function returns the highest-scoring fitting alignment between v and w. Use the BLOSUM62 scoring table.

**8. OverlapAlignment:** The function returns the score of an optimal overlap alignment of v and w, followed by an alignment of a suffix v' of v and a prefix w' of w achieving this maximum score.

**9. AlignmentwithAffineGapPenalties:** The function returns the maximum alignment score between v and w, followed by an alignment of v and w achieving this maximum score.

**10. MiddleEdge:** The MiddleEdge function returns the middle edge in the alignment graph.

**11. LinearSpaceAlignment:** The function returns the maximum alignment score of these strings, followed by an alignment achieving this maximum score.

**12. Greedy Sorting:** The function returns the sequence of permutations corresponding to applying GreedySorting to P, ending with the identity permutation.

**13. Breakpoints:** The function returns the number of breakpoints in this permutation.

**14. TwoBreakSorting:** The function returns the sequence of genomes resulting from applying the shortest sequence of 2-breaks transforming one genome into the other.

**15. SharedKmers:** All k-mers shared by these strings, in the form of ordered pairs (x, y) corresponding to starting positions of these k-mers in the respective strings.

**16. ChromosomeToCycle:** The sequence Nodes of integers between 1 and 2n resulting from applying ChromosomeToCycle to Chromosome.

**17. CycleToChromosome:** The chromosome Chromosome containing n synteny blocks resulting from applying CycleToChromosome to Nodes.

**18. GraphToGenome:** The function returns genome P corresponding to this genome graph (The implementation below is for the assignment of the Course and I used an altered version in TwoBreakSorting).
