1. MahattanTourist: The function returns the length of a longest path in the Manhattan Tourist Problem. 
2. OutputLCS: Given two strings s and t, the function below returns a longest common subsequence of s and t
3. Longest Path DAG: The function below returns the desired output for Longest Path along Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) problem represented above.
4. GlobalAlignment: The maximum alignment score of these strings followed by an alignment achieving this maximum score.
5. LocalAlignment: The maximum score of a local alignment of the strings, followed by a local alignment of these strings achieving the maximum score.
6. EditDistance: The function below returns the edit distance between two strings
7. FittingAlignment: A highest-scoring fitting alignment between v and w. Use the BLOSUM62 scoring table
8. OverlapAlignment: The score of an optimal overlap alignment of v and w, followed by an alignment of a suffix v' of v and a prefix w' of w achieving this maximum score.
9. AlignmentwithAffineGapPenalties: The maximum alignment score between v and w, followed by an alignment of v and w achieving this maximum score.
10. MiddleEdge: The MiddleEdge function below returns middle edge in the alignment graph.
11. LinearSpaceAlignment: The maximum alignment score of these strings, followed by an alignment achieving this maximum score.
12. Greedy Sorting: The sequence of permutations corresponding to applying GreedySorting to P, ending with the identity permutation.
13. Breakpoints: The function below returns the number of breakpoints in this permutation.
14. TwoBreakSorting: The sequence of genomes resulting from applying a shortest sequence of 2-breaks transforming one genome into the other.
15. SharedKmers: All k-mers shared by these strings, in the form of ordered pairs (x, y) corresponding to starting positions of these k-mers in the respective strings.
16. ChromosomeToCycle: The sequence Nodes of integers between 1 and 2n resulting from applying ChromosomeToCycle to Chromosome.
17. CycleToChromosome: The chromosome Chromosome containing n synteny blocks resulting from applying CycleToChromosome to Nodes.
18. GraphToGenome: The genome P corresponding to this genome graph.(The implementation below is for assignment of the Course and I used an altered version in TwoBreakSorting)
