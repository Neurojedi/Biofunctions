The Motif Functions.ipynb file contains useful examples that demonstrate the proper usage of functions. If you are looking to understand how to utilize the functions, you can refer to the jupyter notebook. Below, you can also find a brief overview of the outputs generated by functions in the python files.

1. MotifEnumeration: This file contains `MotifEnumeration` function that returns All (k, d)-motifs in Dna.

2. MedianString: This file contains the `MedianString` function that returns a k-mer pattern that minimizes d(Pattern, Dna) among all possible choices of k-mers. 

3. GreedyMotifSearch: This file contains `GreedyMotifSearch` that returns a collection of strings BestMotifs resulting from applying GreedyMotifSearch(Dna, k, t). 

4. Randomized_MotifSearch: This file contains `Randomized_MotifSearch` that returns a collection BestMotifs resulting from running RandomizedMotifSearch(Dna, k, t) 1,000 times.

5. Gibbs_MotifSearch: This file contains `Gibbs_MotifSearch` that returns the strings BestMotifs resulting from running GibbsSampler(Dna, k, t, N) with 20 random starts.
