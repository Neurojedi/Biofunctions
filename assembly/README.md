The Assembly.ipynb file contains useful examples that demonstrate the proper usage of functions. If you are looking to understand how to utilize the functions, you can refer to the jupyter notebook. Below, you can also find a brief overview of the outputs generated by each function.


**1. Composition:** This file contains `composition` function that returns Compositionk(Text), where the k-mers are arranged in lexicographic order.

**2. PathToGenome:** This file contains `PathToGenome` function that reconstructs a string from its genome path.

**3. OverlapGraph:** This file contains `overlap_graph` and `get_graph` functions that can be used to get the overlap graph Overlap(Patterns), in the form of an adjacency list.

**4. DeBruijnGraph:** This file contains `build_debruijn_from_string`, `build_debruijn_from_kmers` and `get_debruijn_graph` functions that can be used to get DeBruijnk(Text), in the form of an adjacency list or the adjacency list of the de Bruijn graph DeBruijn(Patterns).

**5. EularianCycle:** This file contains `get_EulerianCycle` function that returns the Eulerian cycle in a graph.

**6. EulerianPath:** This file contains `get_EulerianPath` function that returns an Eulerian path in a graph.

**7. EularianReconstruction:** This file contains `StringReconstruction` function that returns string construction using Eulerian Cycles and de Bruijn Graph.

**8. CircularString:** This file contains `get_CircularString` function that returns the k-universal circular string.

**9. PairedReadsReconstruction:** This file contains `StringReconstruction` function that returns a string Text with (k, d)-mer composition equal to PairedReads.

**10. ContigGeneration:** This file contains `get_Contig` function that returns all contigs in a DeBruijn Graph.

**11. StringSpelledByGappedPatterns:** This file contains `StringSpelledByGappedPatterns` function that returns a string Text of length k + d + k + n - 1 such that the i-th (k, d)-mer in Text is equal to (ai|bi) for 1 â‰¤ i â‰¤ n (if such a string exists)

**12. MaximalNonBranchingPaths:** This file contains `MaximalNonBranchingPaths` function that returns the collection of all maximal nonbranching paths in this graph.
